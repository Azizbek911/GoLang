# GoLang
I have started learning Go programming languages, these are what i learnt

# Hello World

`package greetings`

`import "fmt"`


`func Hello() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}`

First i imported fmt library and as you can see i show **Hello World**. The first listen was simple but it was hard to export them another go gile. Because i exported files in JavaScript like that: 
`
const hello = () => {
  console.log("Hello world");
};`

`export hello;
`
